    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="fine">Last updated: 2025-09-05</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what personal data Chaptiva (“we”, “us”) collects, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

    <h3>Data we collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Account and contact: email, name (if provided).</li>

      <li>Integrations: Discord user ID, server/guild ID, role IDs needed to grant/revoke entitlements.</li>
      <li>Usage and logs: timestamps of events (e.g., checkout completed, subscription updated), IP address, and basic device info for security and debugging.</li>
      <li>Cookies: minimal cookies/session data to operate the app. We do not sell personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How we use data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the Service (e.g., grant/revoke roles and perks based on payment status).</li>
      <li>Process payments, prevent fraud, and provide receipts and customer portal access.</li>
      <li>Support, troubleshooting, and service improvement.</li>
      <li>Legal compliance and enforcing our Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Legal bases (EEA/UK)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Contract: to provide the Service you requested.</li>
      <li>Legitimate interests: to secure, improve, and prevent fraud.</li>
      <li>Consent: for optional communications or analytics where required.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>Retention</h3>
    <p>We keep data for as long as needed to provide the Service and as required by law. You may request deletion; some records (e.g., invoices) must be retained for legal obligations.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h3>Your rights</h3>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port your data, and to object or restrict certain processing. To exercise rights, contact support@chaptiva.app.</p>

    <p>We may transfer data to countries outside your own. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses with processors).</p>

    <h3>Children</h3>
    <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect their data.</p>

    <h3>Changes</h3>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated (e.g., email or in‑app).</p>
