<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: August 31, 2025</em></p>
<p>These Terms govern access to and use of Chaptiva (“Service”), which generates multi‑platform video content packs (transcripts, chapters, hooks, titles, SEO descriptions, clip ideas, captions). By submitting a video link or using generated outputs you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. Beta Nature</h2>
<p>The Service is in beta. Features may change, degrade, or be discontinued without prior notice. Do not rely on Chaptiva as your sole storage for critical assets; retain original materials.</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility & Responsibility</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You must have rights or permission to process the video content you submit.</li>
  <li>You affirm the content does not violate intellectual property, privacy, or platform policies.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for how you use generated outputs (e.g., compliance with YouTube, TikTok, Instagram guidelines).</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No submission of unlawful, harassing, defamatory, or infringing content.</li>
  <li>No attempts to bypass technical limitations, rate limits, or security controls.</li>
  <li>No automated bulk scraping or reverse‑engineering of internal models.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Ownership & License</h2>
<p>You retain rights to your underlying video content. You grant us a limited, revocable license to process the provided link and derived text solely to generate and deliver requested outputs. Generated textual outputs are provided “as is.” We may aggregate anonymized statistical patterns (e.g., average processing time) to improve performance.</p>

<h2>5. Payment (If Upgrading)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Paid plans (e.g., “Pro”) are subscription‑based recurring charges until cancellation.</li>
  <li>Pricing may change for new customers; active subscribers keep their current rate while uninterrupted.</li>
  <li>Billing and card data are handled by Stripe or another payment provider; we do not store full card data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
<p>Beta pricing is intentionally low to validate utility. You can cancel future renewals anytime. Refunds for elapsed billing periods are discretionary and generally limited to cases of service failure preventing reasonable usage (at our sole assessment).</p>

<h2>7. Service Modifications & Availability</h2>
<p>We may modify or discontinue any feature. Planned maintenance or downtime may occur. We aim for reasonable notice when practical, but beta status implies potential short‑notice adjustments.</p>

<h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
<p>Outputs (titles, SEO text, hooks, captions) can include errors, omissions, or style mismatches. Verify accuracy—especially for regulated niches (finance, health, legal). We do not guarantee ranking improvements, audience growth, or monetization outcomes.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Chaptiva is not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or loss of profits, data, or goodwill arising from or related to use of (or inability to use) the Service. Aggregate liability shall not exceed the fees paid by you (if any) in the preceding 3 months.</p>

<h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Chaptiva and its operators from claims or liabilities arising from (a) your submitted content, (b) your misuse of outputs, or (c) violation of these Terms or applicable laws.</p>

<h2>11. Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate access for suspected violations, security risks, or abuse. You may cease use at any time. Sections concerning ownership, disclaimers, and liability survive termination.</p>

<h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may revise these Terms. Material changes take effect upon posting and notice (email or banner). Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

<h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
<p>Unless mandatory local law overrides, the governing law for dispute resolution will be the jurisdiction where the operating entity is established (to be specified as the company formalizes). You agree to first attempt informal resolution by contacting us.</p>

<h2>14. Contact</h2>
<p>Email: <a href="mailto:contact@chaptiva.app">contact@chaptiva.app</a></p>

<p class="note">These Terms are a beta baseline and not a substitute for formal legal review. Update as you incorporate a company entity and expand regions.</p>
