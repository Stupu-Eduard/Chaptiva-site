    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
    <p class="fine">Last updated: 2025-09-05</p>

    <p>Chaptiva is a digital subscription. No physical goods are shipped. This policy explains when and how refunds apply.</p>

    <h3>30‑day guarantee (first payment)</h3>
    <p>Your first payment is eligible for a full refund within 30 days of purchase if you’re not satisfied. No questions asked.</p>

    <h3>Renewals charged by mistake</h3>
    <p>If you were unintentionally billed for a renewal, contact us within 7 days of the charge and we’ll refund it.</p>

    <h3>How to request a refund</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Email: support@chaptiva.app</li>
      <li>Include: the email used at checkout and a brief reason (optional)</li>
      <li>Timing: we aim to respond within 2 business days</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Refund method and timing</h3>
    <p>Approved refunds are returned to the original payment method. Banks typically post funds within 5–10 business days after we process the refund.</p>

    <h3>Cancellations</h3>
    <p>You can cancel anytime in the Customer Portal (link in your Stripe receipt). Access continues until the end of the paid period.</p>

    <h3>Access on refund or cancelation</h3>
    <p>On refund or cancelation, Discord roles and in‑game perks are revoked automatically.</p>

    <h3>Abuse and chargebacks</h3>
    <p>We may deny refunds in cases of abuse (e.g., repeated refunds) or fraud. Filing a chargeback will result in immediate entitlement revocation.</p>
